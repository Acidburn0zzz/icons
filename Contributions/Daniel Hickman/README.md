# Daniel Hickman's Icons
Currently learning MD, all icons may have an incorrect whole icon shadow, finish, and keyline object corner radius.

The icon for this pack is made by Vukasin Andelkovic, but until I'm given the okay to add the modified version of his icon into his folder, it's in mine, but I did very little of it.

The licencing for my icons are likely going to change to an even loser version of the CC SA 4.0 licence we have currently.
