# Icon Submission
This is the repo for submitting icons to our project. We thank you for all support!
This is a public icon pack that anyone and everyone is invited to contribute to.

## Folder Organization
To keep things organized, we hope that you'll use this folder system
Contributions --> Real Name and/or (Nickname) --> Vector (or) Not Vector [seperate folders, appropriately organized as such] --> Application Name.extention

This repo will be updated regularly. Please just raise an issue with any questions or suggestions to change anything and it will be done. You can join our G+ community here at: http://goo.gl/yaGBvL , this is where most communication will be done.
