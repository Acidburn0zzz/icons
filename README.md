# Icon Submission
This is the repo for submitting icons to our project. We thank you for all support!
This is a public icon pack that anyone and everyone is invited to contribute to.

## Folder Organization
To keep things organized, we hope that you'll use this folder system
Contributions --> Real Name and/or (Nickname) --> Vector (or) Not Vector [seperate folders, appropriately organized as such] --> Application Name.extention

## Wanted Formats		
If you decide to work with vector graphics, please upload two versions of your icon. One that is whatever file format you normally use to work with, and an SVG. This helps those without special tools to work and to be cross platformal. This is not mandatory, as some icons do not convert well - but regaurdless would be nice to do.

This repo will be updated regularly. Please just raise an issue with any questions or suggestions to change anything and it will be done. You can join our G+ community here at: http://goo.gl/yaGBvL , this is where most communication will be done.
